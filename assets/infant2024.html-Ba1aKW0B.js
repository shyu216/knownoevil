This ensures that only videos where human observers can reliably count RR are included in the analysis, preserving the validity of the algorithm’s evaluation. However, for deployment, an automated method to quantify motion artifacts and define thresholds to identify when RR estimation may be inaccurate will be required, which could be implemented in the next iteration.</p><h2 id="how-they-use-evm" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-they-use-evm"><span>How they use EVM?</span></a></h2><p>They also use αB(x, t) = I(x, t) − Ĩ(x, t).</p><p>Barely mentioned, even without stating their passband frequencies.</p><h2 id="how-their-automatic-roi-selection-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-their-automatic-roi-selection-works"><span>How their automatic ROI selection works?</span></a></h2><ol><li>Sliding window and calculating average intensity for each.</li><li>Perform wavelet-based denoising for each window in time domain.</li><li>Perform K-medoids clustering to classify the windows into 2 clusters.</li></ol><h2 id="how-they-get-rr" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-they-get-rr"><span>How they get RR?</span></a></h2><p>Counting the peaks.</p>',10),r=[n];function s(h,l){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const d=e(i,[["render",s],["__file","infant2024.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/master/research/rrmonitor/infant2024.html","title":"Video-Based Respiratory Rate Estimation for Infants in the NICU","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Video-Based Respiratory Rate Estimation for Infants in the NICU","icon":"note-sticky","timeline":true,"tag":["Signal Processing"],"description":"How they handle the data?

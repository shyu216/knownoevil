It is about what would happen to human society if we discovered that aliens were coming to Earth, The story starts with this big question, and different group of people hold very different opinions.</p><p>Some people are really disappointed with human society, so they hope the aliens can come and help improve our world. However, other people are afraid of the aliens, because they believe only humans can save ourselves. They worry that the aliens might control us and even make us their slaves.</p><p>The story is so attractive that I was totally immersed in it, just like the main character. While reading, it made me think deeply about our lives. On busy days when I am working or studying, reading this book helps me relax. It lets me jump out of the real world, enjoy some interesting ideas, and really sparks my imagination.</p><h1 id="描述一次全新经历" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#描述一次全新经历"><span>描述一次全新经历</span></a></h1><p>I would like to talk about the first time I watched a movie on a plane, which was during my first international trip to Australia for my master&#39;s degree two years ago. I flew from my hometown to Melbourne and the flight was about 9 hours long. It was such a long journey that I definitely needed something to kill time. Luckily, there was a in-flight entertainment system on my seat, so that was my first ever time watching a movie on a plane.</p><p>To be honest, I felt a bit nervous at first, because it was my first time traveling aboard. I decided to turn on the entertainment system and the movie I picked called The Three-Body Problem. It is a sci-fi movie about how people react when they find out aliens are coming to Earth. And the aliens may even conquer us and make us their slaves. It is all about people&#39;s responses in that terrifying situation.</p><p>When I started to watching it, I was totally amazed by its fancy special effects. I got so immersed in that story that I gradually relaxed and even forget I was on a plan for a while. I chose to watch a movie simply because I had nothing to do, and I thought sitting there idle would only make my nervousness worse. This little activity really distracted me and eased my anxiety during the long flight. By the time I finished the movie, I was surprised at how quickly the time had passed, and soon after we landed safely in Melbourne. It was really nice experience that made the long journey bearable and took away my worries about my first international trip.</p><h1 id="优化-简化版" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#优化-简化版"><span>优化,简化版</span></a></h1><p>I&#39;d like to talk about watching a movie on a plane, a new activity I tried in my first international journey to Melbourne for my master&#39;s degree.</p><p>It was a 8 hour long-haul flight and I <code>had some apprehensions(忐忑)</code> at first because I&#39;d never been on such long flight before.

It was a week day and I had been stucked with my assignment for the whole day. I just wanted to finish washing my dished very quickly so I can get back to my assessment right away. I was in such a hurry and suddenly the plate slipped out of my hand, crashing on to the hard floor and shattering into pieces.</p><p>At first, I was shocked by the loud noise. I quickly checked my hand and luckily I was fine. After that I got a dustpan and a brush to clean up all the broken pieces carefully, ensuring there leave no tiny one.</p><p>I tired to save time, but this accident made me spend much more time on cleaning. That is when I really understood the old saying, slow is fast. I had heard it before, but never knew how true it was. It is a great lesson for me, especially when I am busy with my assignements and always rushing.</p>',9)])])}const p=t(n,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/study/ielts/cases/s_accident.html","title":"描述弄坏过什么","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"描述弄坏过什么","icon":"bolt","description":"Describe a time when you broke something You should say: What it was When/where that happened How you broke it And explain what you did after that Part 3 What kind of things are...","head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"描述弄坏过什么\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2026-02-22T03:07:04.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Dale\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/shyu216\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://shyu216.github.io/knownoevil/knownoevil/study/ielts/cases/s_accident.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"SIHONG's Blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"描述弄坏过什么"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Describe a time when you broke something You should say: What it was When/where that happened How you broke it And explain what you did after that Part 3 What kind of things are..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2026-02-22T03:07:04.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2026-02-22T03:07:04.000Z"}]]},"git":{"createdTime":1769853633000,"updatedTime":1771729624000,"contributors":[{"name":"shyu216","username":"shyu216","email":"yusihong073@gmail.com","commits":3,"url":"https://github.com/shyu216"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.16,"words":348},"filePathRelative":"study/ielts/cases/s_accident.md","excerpt":"<p>Describe a time when you broke something</p>\\n<p>You should say:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>What it was</li>\\n<li>When/where that happened</li>\\n<li>How you broke it</li>\\n<li>And explain what you did after that</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Part 3</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>What kind of things are more likely to be broken by people at home?</li>\\n<li>Is it better to repair broken things or to replace them with new ones?</li>\\n<li>Why do some people prefer to fix things themselves rather than replace them?</li>\\n<li>What are the advantages of hand-made clothing items compared to mass-produced ones?</li>\\n<li>How do children learn about the concept of responsibility?</li>\\n<li>What should parents do when children break something?</li>\\n<li>Why do some people try to hide their mistakes?</li>\\n<li>Do you think people are more careful with expensive things than with cheap things?</li>\\n<li>In what situations is breaking something considered very serious?</li>\\n<li>Do you think the way people value objects has changed compared to the past?</li>\\n<li>What can people learn from making mistakes?</li>\\n</ul>","autoDesc":true}`);export{p as comp,d as data};

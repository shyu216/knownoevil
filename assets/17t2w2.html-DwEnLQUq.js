For example, the children could only be allowed to use a phone when they have finished all the homework and they should take a short break in playing video games for every 30 minutes. In addition, parents can also help to find some useful resources for their children, not just games. Recommending the cartoons that parents enjoyed in their childhood would build a bridge to their kids and share a memorable family time together. In that case, the smartphones will not influence child&#39;s score at school, but help them learn a lot of helpful skills and lessons out of school.</p><p>In conclusion, although many people concern that some children spend too much time in playing smartphones, I still hold positive opinion on it.

However, I believe that if children can be helped to <code>develop healthy habits in</code> using new technology, this situation can <code>be transformed into</code> a positive development.</p><p>In the current era, it <code>has become a common phenomenon</code> for many children to spend most of their free time playing with smartphones. The direct consequence of this is that they may struggle to focus on their academic work. Some children even become so excessively addicted to video games that they fail to complete their homework on time after school. What is more concerning is that prolonged and uninterrupted use of smartphones can easily lead to vision problems. A recent study has indicated that the widespread use of smartphones and screen devices is a primary reason why an increasing number of children today require glasses.</p><p><code>Nevertheless</code>, I believe that the impact of a new technology <code>lies not in</code> the technology itself, but in how people use it. From a broader perspective, in the digital age, completely banning children from using smartphones is not a sustainable long-term solution. If parents can actively guide and supervise their children in using smartphones reasonably and wisely, this technology can undoubtedly have a positive and beneficial influence. Firstly, parents should establish clear rules of usage together with their children, such as allowing smartphone use only after completing all homework and taking short breaks after every 30 minutes of gaming. Secondly, parents can proactively help their children discover beneficial resources on smartphones, rather than limiting their use to games alone. For example, recommending high-quality animated shows that parents enjoyed during their own childhood can not only build bridges for parent-child communication but also create meaningful family time spent together. Additionally, the wide variety of educational apps and online learning resources available on smartphones, if utilized appropriately, can serve as effective supplements to classroom learning.</p><p>In conclusion, although many people worry about the potential negative impacts of excessive smartphone use among children, I maintain a cautiously optimistic view. I believe that through proper education and guidance, children can fully harness the strengths of this powerful tool while avoiding its drawbacks, ultimately becoming beneficiaries rather than victims. After all, true education is never about building walls but about lighting a guiding light.</p>",12)])])}const c=t(a,[["render",s]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/study/ielts/cases/17t2w2.html","title":"剑雅17T2大作文","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"剑雅17T2大作文","icon":"file-pen","description":"笨蛋尝试： Nowadays, many parents worry that their children are easily distracted by smartphones and pay less attention in their studies.

As an international student, I live alone and far away from my parents, so I really need to cook by ourselves to survive. Actually, in high school, I just ate in the school canteen with my classmates, and at weekends, my parents cooked for me. So before university, I seldom cooked by myself and I was really bad at it. But I had to face this challenge when I went to university, so I tried to learn cooking through online videos. There are plenty of learning resources online that teach you how to cook simple dishes.</p><p>For example, I learned how to cook scrambled eggs with tomatoes, which is a traditional Chinese cuisine. I just followed the procedure given by the video, and I learned it very quickly. I felt I was a little bit cut out for cooking. I just poured oil into the pan, fried the eggs first, then added the tomatoes and stirred them for several minutes., and all things were done. When it is finished, you just add some soy sauce and salt to it. It tasted really good for me, and it made me feel very confident that I would be able to survive in a foreign country without my parents.</p><p>This skill brings me a sense of independence, and cooking is becoming a relaxing activity for me after my busy study.</p><h1 id="优化-简化版" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#优化-简化版"><span>优化,简化版</span></a></h1><p>The skill I taught by myself is basic home cooking, which I picked up when I studied in Melbourne as an international student. I had to fend for myself, so I learned it by watching online cooking tutorials.</p><p>It didn&#39;t take me long to get the hang of it. I mastered simple dishes like scrambled eggs with tomatoes in just a couple of minutes, by following the step by step guides strictly.</p><p>At first, I was a bit clumsy, but when I made a decent plate of it for the first time, I felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment. Now cooking is a practical skill for me. It saves money, keeps me healthy, and brings me a strong sense of independence. It is even a nice way for me to unwind after busy study.</p><h1 id="需要耐心的事情" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#需要耐心的事情"><span>需要耐心的事情</span></a></h1><p>I&#39;d like to talk about the time I had to be patient when I first cooked scrambled eggs with tomatoes in Melbourne, as an international student.</p><p>I was waiting for the dish to be ready, and I had to do every step slowly. cutting tomatoes into pieces, heating the pan at low fire, stirring the eggs gently. I could&#39;t rush any part of it.</p><p>At first, I felt a bit impatient and wanted to finish it quickly, because I am hungry and not good at cooking. I even almost burned the eggs once because I turned up the fire too fast.</p><p>I needed to be patient simply because cooking is all about slow steps. Rushing would make the dish taste worse or even burn it. Being patient helped me make a decent plate of it finally, and I learned that patient is really important for doing things well.</p><h1 id="一个教了你道理的人" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#一个教了你道理的人"><span>一个教了你道理的人</span></a></h1><p>I&#39;d like to talk about my mom, who taught me the importance of patience in doing things. It is a lesson that is really guided me towards doing things well.</p><p>She taught me this when I learned to cook scrambled eggs with tomatoes from her, a classic Chinese home dish. It has simple but slow steps, like cutting tomatoes into pieces. heating the pan and stirring eggs gently. But I was impatient at first and wanted to rush, so I almost burned the eggs.</p><p>Then my mother helped to turn the heat down and explained that patience is key for cooking. She said rushing would ruin the dish and even waste time making a new one, which is more time-consuming.</p><p>From that moment, I truly understood her lesson, being patient reduces mistakes and keeps everything under control. If you are in a hurry, you will probably mess thing up. This taught me patience is essential for doing anything well, and it is really important in my daily life now.</p>',17)])])}const h=t(i,[["render",s]]),c=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/study/ielts/cases/s_skill.html","title":"描述一技能、习惯、困难","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"title":"描述一技能、习惯、困难","icon":"lightbulb","description":"I would like to talk about the cooking skill I have learned by myself.

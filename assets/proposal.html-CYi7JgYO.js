It is written for an academic reader e.g. for your supervisor or an academic with a similar disciplinary background. By thinking through your entire research project from beginning to end, it may also highlight core issues with the feasibility of the project.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-it" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-in-it"><span>What&#39;s in it?</span></a></h2><p>There are some disciplinary differences regarding exactly what is included in the proposal. For example, disciplines such as Psychology may include a prominent hypothesis statement, others in the Social Sciences including Education, may expect a set of research questions that the study will answer. However, all research proposals should cover the four basic elements below.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-structure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-s-the-structure"><span>What‚Äòs the structure?</span></a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Title or Cover</strong>: Identifies the title of the project, your full name, the institution, department, and supervisor details. The title should be brief and descriptive and may use a colon (üòÉ to separate the topic from the focus (i.e. Stormwater Harvesting: Managing the hazards of surface water pollution by run-off).</p></li><li><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Outlines the essence of the research project. It describes the purpose and motivation for the study, the problem, the data collection methodology and analysis, significant results and implications of the research.</p></li><li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Provides background information for the research (i.e. the problem being addressed) and is typically structured from general information to narrow or focused ideas with your research question/s or hypotheses at the narrow end.</p><p>The Introduction should be about 10% of your proposal.</p><p>Imagine you are writing for a general reader rather than an expert audience. The Introduction includes a brief review of relevant literature or knowledge in the field, so that you are able to present a gap in existing knowledge and, therefore, the significance and originality of your research.</p><p>Finally, articulate the scope of your research (or what you will not be doing) to limit your task. Your research question/s should encapsulate the primary question/s you aim to solve.</p></li><li><p><strong>Literature Review</strong>: Synthesises the literature in your field. Some disciplines will expect to see this in the Introduction but others will want it placed in this ‚Äòstand-alone‚Äô section (especially in more Humanities-based fields). Again, it could be structured from broad to narrow, so literature on the more general aspects of your topic could come first, narrowing down to published work on your particular area of interest. You might end this section by including a short summary of the main themes you have identified from the literature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Research Design or Methodology</strong>: Includes a description and rationale for the methods of data collection and analysis, and the materials you will use in your research. Use subheadings if possible (i.e. Data Collection, Data Analysis, Ethical Considerations etc.) and write with a future aspect, (i.e. The research will initially examine water treatment processes in...)</p></li><li><p><strong>Timeline</strong>: Lists the stages of the research project in timeline, spreadsheet or tabular format, and the deadlines for completion of these stages or tasks. You should include any anticipated challenges to completion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Significance and Implications</strong>: Relates the expected outcomes of your research to the aims expressed in the Introduction so that the need for the study and the contribution to knowledge is clear.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reference List</strong></p></li></ol><h2 id="what-should-i-begin-with" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-should-i-begin-with"><span>What should I begin with?</span></a></h2><p>If you are starting a ‚Äòfresh‚Äô project you might consider two key questions:</p><ul><li>What am I really interested in finding out about my research topic?</li><li>How am I going to do this in practice? Brainstorm responses to these questions under a strict time limit ‚Äì say 30 minutes.</li></ul><p>Then leave this ‚Äòfree-writing‚Äô for at least 24 hours before reviewing it for a possible more polished second draft.</p><h2 id="how-should-i-approach-a-literature" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-should-i-approach-a-literature"><span>How should I approach a literature?</span></a></h2><p>Try the following techniques for dealing with the literature:</p><ul><li>Develop a theme or series of themes from your broad reading, referencing the work of relevant authors who support your position or who provide counter-arguments against your point/s.</li><li>Limit excessive quoting. Too many direct quotations will dilute your authority over the topic.</li><li>Avoid beginning paragraphs with ‚ÄúJones argues ‚Ä¶‚Äù; ‚ÄúSmith states ‚Ä¶‚Äù This approach risks losing a sense of your writer‚Äôs authority to the work of others. Instead, provide an overview of the paragraph in a topic sentence written in your own writer‚Äôs voice.</li></ul><h2 id="are-there-any-tips" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#are-there-any-tips"><span>Are there any tips?</span></a></h2><ul><li><p>Avoid language that is overly hesitant or tentative (i.e. ‚ÄòIt seems that‚Ä¶‚Äô, ‚ÄòIt is hoped that ‚Ä¶‚Äô). Instead, use confident language when you feel able to (i.e. ‚ÄòIt is clear that‚Ä¶‚Äô, ‚ÄòI assert that ‚Ä¶‚Äô).</p></li><li><p>Break up large blocks of text into smaller sections using sub-headings and bullet-points.</p></li><li><p>Anticipate possible problems with, or limitations of, your research. Address these issues directly for your own benefit as well as to improve the entire proposal.</p></li><li><p>Make your proposal is easy for readers to skim read. Never assume your readers will read your work in a ‚Äòlogical‚Äô order. Use sub-headings and restate key ideas to guide the reader through your writing.</p></li><li><p>Find copies of other Research Proposals in your field and study the way they:</p><ul><li>devise titles.</li><li>structure their proposal.</li><li>use discipline-specific language.</li></ul></li><li><p>Take a note of anything else you notice.</p></li></ul>',16),s=[o];function n(l,h){return r(),t("div",null,s)}const u=e(a,[["render",n],["__file","proposal.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/other/proposal.html","title":"How to Write a Research Proposal","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Write a Research Proposal","shortTitle":"Research Proposal","icon":"feather","category":["Skills"],"tag":["Skills"],"description":"source: https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/resources/reading,-writing-and-referencing/referencing-and-research/research-proposals MCS_proposal_suggestions What's it...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://shyu216.github.io/knownoevil/knownoevil/other/proposal.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"SIHONG's Blog"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"How to Write a Research Proposal"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"source: https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/resources/reading,-writing-and-referencing/referencing-and-research/research-proposals MCS_proposal_suggestions What's it..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-03-15T21:54:15.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Dale"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Skills"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-03-15T21:54:15.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"How to Write a Research Proposal\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-03-15T21:54:15.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Dale\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://github.com/shyu216\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"What's it for?","slug":"what-s-it-for","link":"#what-s-it-for","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"What's in it?","slug":"what-s-in-it","link":"#what-s-in-it","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"What‚Äòs the structure?","slug":"what-s-the-structure","link":"#what-s-the-structure","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"What should I begin with?","slug":"what-should-i-begin-with","link":"#what-should-i-begin-with","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"How should I approach a literature?","slug":"how-should-i-approach-a-literature","link":"#how-should-i-approach-a-literature","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Are there any tips?","slug":"are-there-any-tips","link":"#are-there-any-tips","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1742075655000,"updatedTime":1742075655000,"contributors":[{"name":"shyu216","email":"sihong1@student.unimelb.edu.au","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"other/proposal.md","localizedDate":"March 15, 2025","excerpt":"<ul>\\n<li>source: <a href=\\"https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/resources/reading,-writing-and-referencing/referencing-and-research/research-proposals\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/resources/reading,-writing-and-referencing/referencing-and-research/research-proposals</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https://github.com/shyu216/knownoevil/blob/main/assets/MCS_proposal_suggestions.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener noreferrer\\">MCS_proposal_suggestions</a></li>\\n</ul>","autoDesc":true}`);export{u as comp,d as data};

The roundabout will be retained, but its southwest and southeast corners will be redeveloped into shops and a medical centre. The former eastern street will now feature a school on its north side and a playground on its south side, with housing lining both sides. Additionally, a new road will extend northeast from the roundabout, crossing the river via a bridge to connect with the northern farmland, where further housing will be built. The southern entrance from the town road will also be upgraded.</p><p>In summary, the redevelopment will replace industry with housing and essential facilities, while also expanding residential space northward across the river.</p><p>地图题常见道路表达（速查版）：</p><ul><li>十字路口: crossroads / intersection / junction</li><li>T 字路口: T-junction</li><li>环形路口/转盘: roundabout</li><li>在路的尽头: at the end of the road</li><li>死胡同: dead end street</li><li>在……对面: opposite</li><li>从 A 通向 B: a road runs / leads from A to B</li><li>连接 A 和 B: connect A and B / provide access to</li><li>在路北侧：on north side of the road</li><li>在路两旁：on both sides of the road</li></ul><p>道路：</p><ul><li>highway / expressway</li><li>main road / secondary road</li><li>street</li><li>footpath</li></ul><p>让那个笨蛋再写一遍：</p><p>The maps illustrate an industrial area in the town of Norbiton at present and how it is planned to be developed in the future.</p><p>Overall, all factories will be replaced by residential buildings, with a variety of supporting facilities, and the range will be extended across the river to open farmland in the north.</p><p>Initially, this area is surrounded by a river in the north and a main road in the south.

title: Redo My NLP Course Project
icon: language

My NLP course project was not very good, and I was not happy with the result.
I want to redo the project from scratch, at my own pace.

Simple goals:

- Clean the dataset better and write clear preprocessing code.
- Try a few classic models and at least one modern model.
- Use an LLM assistant (for example Doubao) to help with ideas and code.
- Write a short report in clear English about what works and what fails.

This is not for marks anymore. It is for learning and for building a small but solid NLP portfolio piece.

title: Play with SQL and PySpark
icon: database
---

I learned some SQL at university, but I have never used PySpark.
I want to try modern data tools like Spark and big data platforms.

Simple goals:

- Install PySpark and run it on my laptop.
- Load a small dataset and query it with SQL.
- Compare SQL on a normal database and on Spark.
- Maybe build a tiny data pipeline or dashboard.

I do not want a huge project. I just want to understand how PySpark feels in real work, and write down some notes about what is easy and what is painful.

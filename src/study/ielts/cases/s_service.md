I would like to talk about the time I got really good service at the Chinese restaurant last year right after my final exam week. I have been studying like crazy for hours every single day reviewing course notes and setting for all my written exams so I was totally exhausted, and also a little homesick being abroad I really needed to relax and have a taste of home cooked Chinese food so I opened Google map randomly picked a Chinese restaurant near my place, even though it's rating wasn't that high. I thought it was convenient and gave it a try

when I walked in a friendly lady, came up to me, straight away with a big smile
She greeted me very politely and led me to a nice table which immediately made me feel welcome. To be honest. I had some apprehensions before going in because of the low rate but homes totally put me at ease. I just ordered some classic dishes and the service was amazing the whole time they deliver the staff deliver the food to me very quickly, and whenever I needed an extra spoon or a pair of chopsticks, they just bring them to me super quickly write the way they was. They were so attentive and never made me wait.

And the best part was the food was incredibly authentic just like the dishes I used to eat in my hometown in China. It tasted so familiar and comforting, which really hit the spot for my home sickness. that meal and the great service didn't just fill in my stomach, they totally left my mood after the stressful exam. i left the restaurant, feeling really content and relaxed and it feel like a little treat for my self. After all the hard work this was such a nice surprise, and I still think it was the perfect way to unwind after my finals.

I would like to talk about a time I got good service in a Chinese restaurant

it happened last year after my final exams in the Chinese restaurant near my home

I was buying dinner there. I ordered some Chinese dishes because I was home sick after the exams. 

The service was very good and nice lady with me only and the staff brought me things quickly when I needed them. The food was also authentic. 

I feel really happy and relaxed. It was a great fit for me after all my hard work and it made me less homesick

一个笨蛋的尝试：

I would like to talk about a time I accidentally broke a plate last month. It was a week day and I had been stucked with my assignment for the whole day. I just wanted to finish washing my dished very quickly so I can get back to my assessment right away. I was in such a hurry and suddenly the plate slipped out of my hand, crashing on to the hard floor and shattering into pieces.

At first, I was shocked by the loud noise. I quickly checked my hand and luckily I was fine. After that I got a dustpan and a brush to clean up all the broken pieces carefully, ensuring there leave no tiny one.

I tired to save time, but this accident made me spend much more time on cleaning. That is when I really understood the old saying, slow is fast. I had heard it before, but never knew how true it was. It is a great lesson for me, especially when I am busy with my assignements and always rushing.

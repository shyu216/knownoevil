# 胡说八道指南

目标：**在脑子一片空白时，也能稳稳说满时间、说清意思、不慌乱。**

核心思路：

1. 有一个永远能用的结构；
2. 有一套固定的“万能句型”；
3. 围绕少数熟悉话题，提前想好 2–3 套故事。

---

## 一、万能结构：5 块拼图

任何题目，先在脑子里默念这 5 块：

1. **时间**：When
2. **地点**：Where
3. **人物**：Who（和谁）
4. **事件**：What（发生了什么 / 你做了什么）
5. **感受**：How you felt / Why

用一句话串起来：

> When + Where + With whom + What + How/Why

例：Describe a happy experience.

- It happened **last summer** (when)
- in **a small café near my university** (where)
- with **two of my close friends** (who)
- we **celebrated my graduation** (what)
- and I **felt really proud and relaxed** (how).

这就是 Part 2 的第一段骨架，后面只需要多加细节。

---

## 二、时间线扩展：过去–现在–未来

不会说太多内容时，就按时间线凑句子：

1. **过去**：以前怎么样？
	- When I was a child, ...
	- In the past, people used to...

2. **现在**：现在有什么变化？
	- Nowadays, I usually...
	- These days, it has become more common to...

3. **未来**：你希望/预测怎样？
	- In the future, I hope I can...
	- I think this trend will continue because...

任何话题都可以用这 3 段，基本够时间。

---

## 三、因果 + 转折：让话听起来“有脑子”

### 1. 因果

- because / since / as
- so / therefore / as a result

实用句型：

- I enjoy it **because** it helps me relax.
- It is becoming more popular, **so** many young people are trying it.

### 2. 转折

- but / however / on the other hand / although

实用句型：

- I like working in a team, **but** sometimes it is hard to make decisions.
- **Although** it is convenient, it can also be a bit expensive.

说不下去时，加一句“however/although”转个弯，又能多说两句。

---

## 四、8 大高频话题：提前想故事

你写的 8 个关键词就是最常考的：

- 快乐 happiness
- 知识 knowledge / study
- 成功 success / achievement
- 健康 health
- 爱情 love / relationship
- 友谊 friendship
- 家庭 family
- 社会 society / community

建议：**每个主题准备 1–2 个小故事**，可以多题复用。例如：

### 1. 家庭 + 快乐 + 成功

- 高考 / 毕业 / 获奖那天，家人一起庆祝 → happy + success + family

### 2. 友谊 + 知识 + 健康

- 跟朋友一起跑步、减肥，同时互相督促学习 → friendship + health + knowledge

### 3. 社会 + 知识

- 参加志愿活动 / 支教 / 社区项目 → society + knowledge + happiness

这样你只需要准备少数几个“核心故事”，在考场上换个角度使用。

---

## 五、Part 2 简易模板（卡片题）

拿到卡片后，记住四行：

1. **开头句**：自然引入
	- I’d like to talk about...

2. **5 块信息**（时间、地点、人物、事件、感受）
	- It happened last year / when I was in high school...
	- It took place in...
	- I was with...
	- We...
	- I felt...

3. **时间线扩展**（过去/现在/未来随便挑 2 个）
	- In the past, I...
	- Nowadays, I...
	- In the future, I think...

4. **总结句**
	- That’s why this experience is really unforgettable for me.
	- So overall, it was a really meaningful moment in my life.

按照这个顺序念下来，基本可以说满 1 分半到 2 分钟。

---

## 六、Part 3：把 Part 2 放大

Part 3 是“更抽象的聊天”，但你可以继续用前面的积木：

1. 先给**直接回答**（Yes/No/It depends）。
2. 给一个**原因**（because...）。
3. 加一个**例子/场景**（For example...）。
4. 最后加一句**小总结 / 预测**（So I think... / In the future...）。

示例：Do you think success is important for young people?

Yes, I think success is quite important for young people, **because** it gives them confidence and motivation. **For example**, when students do well in exams or competitions, they feel more confident and are more willing to try new things. **As a result**, they may set higher goals for themselves in the future.

## 七、条件反射  

- 如果说着说着跑题了，想 pause 一下「拉回题目」：  
  - I derailed, anyways
  - *Anyway, to go back to the question, I think…*  
  - *So, getting back to the topic, I’d say…*  
  - *In short, about this question, I think…*  

- 如果一下子蒙了 / 不太熟悉这个话题：  
  - *I’m not really familiar with X, but from what I’ve heard, it’s quite similar to Y.*  
  - *I’m not very familiar with this topic, but I guess…*  
  - *I haven’t experienced this myself, but I think…*  

- pause 和 em / ah / you know：  
  - 短暂停顿（0.5–1 秒）+ 上面这些句子 **比** 一直说 *em, ah, you know* 好。

难的表述

- The sunlight spills into the room： In the Southern Hemisphere, north facing houses catch more sunlight all year round because the sun stays in the northern sky most of the time. Being bathed in sunlight all day lifts my mood a lot. Especially for someone who is always in a hurry, this kind of natural warmth is really nourishing.
- I had a lot of apprehension about this at first 我之前对这件事非常紧张 / 担心 / 不安

- Running：My leg feels heavy/sour。 I can feel my heart working hard to pump blood all around my body. My breathing gets faster too. When running, there is often a gentle breeze that blows. It is so refreshing, like a soft touch on my face. After running, my body feels so alive. Doing aerobic exercises like running is a great way to boost our cariovascular system and make the heart stronger.
  - After a day of sitting, I knew exercise was needed to wake up my body and make my mind sharp again.
  - Some people might say that focusing too much on building big muscles in the gym can lead to an overemphasis on apperance over functionality. less flexible but more confident?

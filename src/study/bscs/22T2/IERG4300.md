### Core Course Content
This course focuses on **data-intensive analytics and automated processing of massive structured/unstructured data**, centering on MapReduce and parallel computing paradigms for web-scale data processing. Key topics include:
1. MapReduce computational model, system architecture and practical implementation
2. Frequent Item-sets & Association Rules mining, similar items search in high-dimensional data
3. Dimensionality Reduction techniques, Clustering algorithms and Recommendation systems
4. Massive Graph analysis and its applications on the World Wide Web
5. Large-scale supervised machine learning
6. Data Streams processing & mining, and applications in large-scale network/online-activity monitoring

### Outcomes
Systematic mastered the design of parallel algorithms for web-scale data processing, and gained practical experience in MapReduce-based massive data analysis, laying a solid foundation for subsequent big data and distributed computing related practice.

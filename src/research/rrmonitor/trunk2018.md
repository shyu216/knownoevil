## What background they describe?

- Both tests start with a few cycles of normal breathing, called tidal volume, followed by a maximal inhalation–exhalation, called main effort.
- Spirometer: Difficult for anyone to use. Recalibrated. Expensive.
- when a single depth sensor is used, decoupling trunk motion and chest-surface respiratory motion would be potentially impossible.

## What is the evaluation metric?

- $NL_2$: Normalized L2 error, 
- $FRD$: Fréchet distance,
- $DTW$: Dynamic Time Warping distance,
- $R^2$: Coefficient of determination correlation.

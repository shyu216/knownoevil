The XV Scanner™ is the world’s only fully dedicated X-ray lung function scanner, designed to do something completely unique–capture a single, full-breath cycle in motion, from four different angles simultaneously.


To optimise the scanning procedure, it is desirable to have a real-time, non-contact method for monitoring the patient’s breathing. This project is focused on the development of a depth-camera based breath tracking method/algorithm to extract a highly dependable, real-time breath trace from a seated patient. As the breath trace may be used for automatically initiating and terminating X-ray exposures during the patient’s breathing cycle.


The project will collaborate with 4DMedical and require considering the following:

- Exploring the integration of machine learning techniques with traditional computer vision algorithms.
- Consideration of camera positioning, geometry and utilisation of multiple cameras.
- Designing to handle factors such as patient size, shape, and non-breath related movements.
- Real-time signal processing and filtering to optimise the breath trace output.
- Testing and evaluation of the preferred approaches performance and reliability.

# What is the findings?

The gyroscope outperformed the accelerometer (rotation)


These results provided evidence of the feasibility of the proposed approach with a degree of performance and feasibility dependent on the posture of the subject, under the conditions of keeping the head still, setting the grounds for future studies in real-world applications of HR and RESP rate measurement through VR headsets.

Based on the obtained results, the proposed approach could provide reasonably accurate results relevant to mean HR only when the subject is in sitting position and complies with the condition of not moving the head for about 20 to 30 s.

任何周期性的信号都可以分解为一系列频率为基频整数倍的正弦波（谐波）之和。心跳有谐波，要消除。

# What is the steps?

For accelerometer, using `a_total = sqrt( a_x² + a_y² + a_z² )`.

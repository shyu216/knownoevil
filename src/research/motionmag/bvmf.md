# What is the idea?

LoGF + GF, two kernels running in temporal and intensity domain, non-shifted response.

# What is Fourier shift theorem?

The shifted version in time domain equals to the phase change in frequency domain. The frequency of each sinusoidal component is shifted by the same amount as the time shift.

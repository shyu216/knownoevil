### What is multivariable calculus?

Multivariable calculus is the extension of calculus in one variable to calculus in more than one variable. It is a branch of calculus that studies functions of more than one variable. It is used in many fields of science and engineering, especially in physics and engineering. Multivariable calculus is also known as vector calculus, as it deals with vectors and vector functions.

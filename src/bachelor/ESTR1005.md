### What is linear algebra?

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces. It is a fundamental part of modern mathematics and has many applications in science and engineering. Linear algebra is used in a wide range of fields, including physics, computer science, economics, and engineering. It is used to solve systems of linear equations, analyze data, and study the properties of geometric objects. Linear algebra is also used in computer graphics, machine learning, and cryptography.

### What is calculus?

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change. Calculus is divided into two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus deals with the study of rates of change, while integral calculus deals with the study of areas and volumes. Together, these two branches of calculus form the foundation of modern mathematics and science.

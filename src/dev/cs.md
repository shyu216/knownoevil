### What is `yield` in C#?

- `yield return` allows you to return elements from a collection one at a time, enabling lazy evaluation and efficient memory usage.
- When you use `yield return` in an iterator method, it returns an `IEnumerator` object.
- You can iterate through the elements using the `MoveNext()` method to advance to the next item and the `Current` property to access the current element.

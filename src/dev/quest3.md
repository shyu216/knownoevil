### How to set up the Meta Quest 3 for development?

Prepare a developer account by email verification, then download a mobile app and a windows app. Suggested to use Unity for dev. Releases are apk files.

For details, follow some youtube videos or the official documentation.

### How to perform dev test?

Normal Unity dev test is just to click the triangle button in the Unity editor. It will open Link app on the Quest 3, and you can see the app running in the headset.

But the PassthroughWebCam does not support this, so I need to build the app and install it on the Quest 3.

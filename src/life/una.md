今天被 Arctic Shores 的行为测试“扒了底裤”。


### 1. How you attend to tasks and decisions 2/4
- You tend to remain fairly focused and attentive, but you're likely to benefit from working in less distracting environments so can focus on information that is relevant to the task at hand.
- You tend to make quick decisions, but these are not always optimal. You're likely to make better decisions when you take a moment to reflect on things before responding.
- You may be able to direct your attention towards addressing the problem or challenge at hand, but at times you're likely to get distracted by unhelpful thoughts and emotions.

### 2. How you approach challenges 2/4
- You're likely to demonstrate short bursts of effort towards achieving your goals, which tends to be most useful for short-term projects and tasks with quick turnaround times that don't demand long-term, sustained effort.
- You can sometimes push through feelings of frustration or deflation when faced with setbacks or obstacles, which can help you to remain engaged with pursuing your goals.
- You're likely to approach challenges with some level of confidence, but you may feel like certain goals are out of reach at times. Seeking support or encouragement from others may help boost your self-confidence.
- You're likely to give challenges a go, but tend not to persist if they require continuous trial and error in order to get things done.

### 3. How you identify patterns and rules 3/4
- You're likely to identify effective solutions to solve novel or complex problems.
- You're likely to grasp new information and make sense of complex concepts. This can help you navigate novel situations by applying this new knowledge effectively.
- You're likely to gather evidence and critically evaluate information. This can help you to make well grounded and accurate judgements.
- You're likely to identify different trends and patterns, helping you to draw similarities between past and present situations. This can enhance your strategic foresight; by thinking ahead, anticipating changes, and making effective decisions.

### 4. How you learn from information in your environment 2/4
- You're likely to learn gradually from information in your environment by connecting observations or information with results, which may support your acquisition of relevant knowledge and skills.
- You're likely to notice some patterns between certain behaviours, interactions, or contexts and their probable outcomes, though you may need more time to do so consistently. Taking this time to reflect may help you uncover insights that support your ability to anticipate how social situations may unfold.
- You're likely to navigate situations with uncertain outcomes, but you may need some additional time to grasp how different pieces of information and events relate to potential outcomes. This extra time can help you improve your ability to anticipate how situations may develop.

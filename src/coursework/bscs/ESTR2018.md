### What is probability?

Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a measure of the likelihood that a given event will occur. Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events. It is used to predict the likelihood of future events and to analyze the past. Probability is used in a wide range of fields, including science, engineering, business, and social sciences.

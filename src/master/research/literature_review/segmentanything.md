## What is the idea?

Motivated by LLM's strong zero-shot generalisation capabilities. In this work, our goal is to build a foundation model for
image segmentation. That is, we seek to develop a prompt-
able model and pre-train it on a broad dataset using a task
that enables powerful generalisation.

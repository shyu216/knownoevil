## What are all the supported modes?

USB 3 could support 1280x720 @ 30fps, USB 2 only supports 640x480 @ 30fps.

## Problems on Windows

Pyrealsense does not support Python 3.12 on Windows, so pip cannot find it.

## Problems on macOS

On macOS, it can be installed by `brew install librealsense`. There are examples to run in the `/usr/local/Cellar/librealsense/2.56.3/bin`. And sudo is needed.

Can use[ `pyrealsense2-macosx`](https://github.com/cansik/pyrealsense2-macosx). [Sudo needed](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/9916#issuecomment-1082893427).

When activate color stream, the frames doesn't arrive when running the code in the second time. Remove and insert the USB again can solve.

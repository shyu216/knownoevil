## 1. Introduction

- portability
- ubiquitous computing 无处不在的计算
- context

## 2. UI Development for Mobile Devices

- interface: keyboard, screen, transparent/foldable screen, augmented reality
- computing power
- technology's progress is fast; human's evolution is slow
- what, why, who, how
- research: discover, define; design: execute, deliver
- action cycle: the world --> evaluation --> goals --> execution --> the world
  - evaluation:
    - perceiving the state of the world
    - interpreting the perception
    - evaluation of interpretation
  - execution:
    - intention to act
    - sequence of actions
    - execution of the sequence of actions
- cross-platform design: watch, phone, etc.
- usability
  - learnability
  - efficiency
  - memorability
  - errors
  - satisfaction

## 3. Sensors and Signal Processing

- technology --> perception/experiences of reality --> manipulate humans (good and bad)
- ubiquitous interaction: on the user vs in the environment 
- hardware renaissance 硬件复兴
  - rapid prototyping 快速原型设计
  - mass customization 大规模定制
  - cheap development 低成本开发
- moore's law: the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years 每两年芯片上的晶体管数量翻倍
- physical magnitude/phenomenon 物理量/现象 --> sensor --> data
- mobile sensors：
  - camera 
  - magnetometer 磁力计
  - ambient light sensor 环境光传感器
  - gyroscope 陀螺仪
  - microphone
  - barometer 气压计
  - GPS
  - fingerprint 指纹
- activity lifecycle: when listening, when not listening, i.e., battery concern
- measurement
  - $z_i  = x_i + v_i$
  - $z_i$: measurement
  - $x_i$: true value
  - $v_i$: noise, in the form of Gaussian distribution
- mean filter: 
  - $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$
- mean/median filter: 
  - easy to implement
  - efficient
  - great cost benefit
  - laggy 滞后的
  - no dynamic model
- Kalman filter: predictive
  - dynamic model
  - no lag
  - tunable trade-off between model and measurement
  - uncertainty estimate
  - cheap to run
  - parameter not intuitive
  - overshooting 超调

## 4. Location Based System

- reality reproduction
  - acquisition
  - processing
  - display
  - perception
- Global Positioning System (GPS) from 1970
- indoor localization
  - Nintendo 3DS
- visual localization
- localization systems
  - client-based location system
    - device computes its own location
    - GPS
    - privacy, local computation power
  - network-based location system
    - network infrastructure calculates position of device
    - Active Badge system
    - low cost, low privacy
  - network-assisted location system
    - Assisted GPS (基站)
    - fast, accuracy, data charge
- location representation
  - absolute: address, GPS coordinates
  - relative: A is 3km south of B
  - symbolic: descriptive, e.g. home, work
- determine location
  - proximity 接近度
    - if in a range
    - strength of signal
    - time of flight (ToF)
  - trilateration 三边定位
    - 3 circles determine a point
  - hyperbolic lateration 双曲线定位
    - signal arrival time

    - angle of arrival (AoA)
    - antenna 
  - fingerprint
    - signal characteristic
    - temporal stability
    - spatial variability
    - collect data --> training --> localization
  - dead reckoning 
    - direction computed from previously
    - location
    - elapsed time
    - direction
    - average speed
  - visual localization
     - cameras, depth sensors
     - Structure from Motion (SfM)
     - visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) 

## 5. Context Awareness

- goal: intelligent behaviors
- context/information: location, time, event, environment, etc.
- “The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” Mark Weiser, 1991
- proactive applications: anticipate user needs
- collected data: tagging, sharing
- Human Activity Recognition (HAR) System
  - execution
  - generalization
  - recognition
  - activities
  - system model
- choosing a sensor
  - accuracy: how close to the true value
  - precision: how close to each other
  - operating range
  - resolution or sensitivity
  - cost
  - energy consumption
  - lifespan
- handling data
  - raw data
  - preprocessing
  - segmentation
  - feature extraction
  - classification
  - context determination


## 7. Prototyping

- design techniques
  - sketching: ideation, refinement
  - storyboarding
  - prototyping: evaluation, usability
- prototyping
- low-fidelity prototype
  - concept of operation
  - requirement and architecture
  - detailed design
  - implementation
  - integration, test adn verification
  - system verification and validation
  - operation and maintain
- what to prototype
  - workflow, task
  - screen layouts and information displays
  - difficult, controversial, critical areas
  - ...
- fidelity vs functionality
- evolutionary vs throwaway
- horizontal vs vertical
  - horizontal: all screens, no functionality
  - vertical: some functionality in some screens
- Which aspect of your project do you want to test?
- keep it cheap and dirty
- encourage feedback!
- native vs cross-platform
  - native: rich APIs, all functions, need license
  - cross-platform: HTML5
- frameworks
  - RN: Facebook, JS

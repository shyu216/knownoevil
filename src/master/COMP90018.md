[Ubiquitous Computing Fundamentals](https://research.ebsco.com/c/xppotz/search/details/2n7loxcgbj?limiters=FT1%3AY&q=Ubiquitous+Computing+Fundamentals)

:::

## 1. Introduction

- portability
- ubiquitous computing
- context

## 2. UI Developemnt for Mobile Devices

- interface: keyboard, screen, transparent/foldable screen, augmented reality
- computing power
- technology's progress is fast; human's evolution is slow
- what, why, who, how
- research: discoverm define; design: execute, deliver
- action cycle: the world --> evaluation --> goals --> execution --> the world
  - evaluation:
    - perceiving the state of the world
    - interpreting the perception
    - evaluation of interpretation
  - execution:
    - intention to act
    - sequence of actions
    - execution of the sequence of actions
- cross-platform design: watch, phone, etc.
- usability
  - learnability
  - efficiency
  - memorability

:::

## 1. Introduction

- portability
- ubiquitous computing 无处不在的计算
- context

## 2. UI Developemnt for Mobile Devices

- interface: keyboard, screen, transparent/foldable screen, augmented reality
- computing power
- technology's progress is fast; human's evolution is slow
- what, why, who, how
- research: discoverm define; design: execute, deliver
- action cycle: the world --> evaluation --> goals --> execution --> the world
  - evaluation:
    - perceiving the state of the world
    - interpreting the perception
    - evaluation of interpretation
  - execution:
    - intention to act
    - sequence of actions
    - execution of the sequence of actions
- cross-platform design: watch, phone, etc.
- usability
  - learnability
  - efficiency
  - memorability
  - errors
  - satisfaction
  


### Assignment 1 Discussion 1

- AR in Surgery/Medicine
- remote surgery
- 3D reconstruction
- simulate the patient's body
- does AR need radio?
- training

- limitation
  - resolution
  - latency

We work for an industry leading user interaction company. A medical institution has expressed interest in exploring the use of augmented reality that they have heard can enhance multiple factors of their business and experience.  The client wishes to understand the potential of this technology when incorporated into their domain. You are expected to produce a report that provides a comprehensive evaluation of the technology that will equip the client with the necessary insights to make an informed decision about the new technology in their domain, offering insights into the technologies capabilities, benefits and challenges.

## 3. Sensors and Signal Processing

- technology --> perception/experiences of reality --> manipulate humans (good and bad)
- ubiquitous interaction: on the user vs in the environment 
- hardware renaissance 硬件复兴
  - rapid prototyping 快速原型设计
  - mass customization 大规模定制
  - cheap development 低成本开发
- moore's law: the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years 每两年芯片上的晶体管数量翻倍
- physical magnitude/pheonomenon 物理量/现象 --> sensor --> data
- mobile sensors：
  - camera 
  - magnetometer 磁力计
  - ambient light sensor 环境光传感器
  - gyproscope 陀螺仪
  - microphone
  - barometer 气压计
  - GPS
  - fingerprint 指纹
- activity lifecycle: when listening, when not listening, i.e., battery concern
- messurement
  - $z_i  = x_i + v_i$
  - $z_i$: measurement
  - $x_i$: true value
  - $v_i$: noise, in the form of Gaussian distribution
- mean filter: 
  - $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$
- mean/median filter: 
  - easy to implement
  - efficient
  - great cost benefit
  - laggy 滞后的
  - no dynamic model
- Kalman filter: predictive
  - dynamic model
  - no lag
  - tunable trade-off between model and measurement
  - uncertainty estimate
  - cheap to run
  - parameter no ituitive
  - overshooting 超调


### Assignment 1 Discussion 2

- who is the client
  - what current situation, to what motivation for change
  - regional hospital
  - CHI
  - ubitious computing
- who can benefit
  - patient

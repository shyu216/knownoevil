### What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP is used in a wide range of applications, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and speech recognition.

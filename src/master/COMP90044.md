## 1. Introduction

- research methods
- topic: not too specific, not too broad

## 2. Literature Review

- machine learning/LLM + material/chemestry expriment design
- skills
  - finding, reading, understanding papers
  - formulating a research question
  - wirting own papers
  - planning
  - connect question and evidence
  - ...
- graphene, do experiment with tape --> nobel prize
- research =/= search
- knnowledge < skills
- research topic: board subject area
- research problem: board issue, e.g. concern, gap, improvement
- research questionn: a sepecific query, with scope
- practical problem: from observation, find solution
- conceptual problem: idea, theory, model
- refine question
- good research question: clear, focused, researchable, sufficiently complex
- formulate it:
  - identify a boarder subject
  - research on exisitng literature and data
  - ...
- 3 step formula:
  - topic: i am studying [xxx]

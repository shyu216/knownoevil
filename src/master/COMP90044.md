## 1. Introduction

- research methods
- topic: not too specific, not too broad

## 2. Literature Review

- machine learning/LLM + material/chemistry experiment design
- skills
  - finding, reading, understanding papers
  - formulating a research question
  - writing own papers
  - planning
  - connect question and evidence
  - ...
- grapheme, do experiment with tape --> nobel prize
- research =/= search
- knowledge < skills
- research topic: board subject area
- research problem: board issue, e.g. concern, gap, improvement
- research question: a specific query, with scope
- practical problem: from observation, find solution
- conceptual problem: idea, theory, model
- refine question
- good research question: clear, focused, researchable, sufficiently complex
- formulate it:
  - identify a boarder subject
  - research on existing literature and data
  - ...
- 3 step formula:
  - topic: i am studying [xxx]
  - question: because i want to fin out why/what/how [xxx]
  - significance: in order to help the reader understand [xxx]
- tips:
  - anticipate future directions --- futuristic thinking
  - reflect on personal curiosity/ambition/expertise
  - government reports
- hypothesis: reasoned assumption/informed intuition
- scientific literature:
  - peer-reviewed journals
  - books by reputable publishers
  - reputable conference papers
  - theses and dissertations
- purpose of literature review
  - provide understanding
  - identify gap
  - establish a theoretical framework
  - highlight the significance
- AI tools for finding papers
- keep purpose in mind

## 3. Writing about Research

- expectations
  - originality and contribution
  - clarity and precision
  - logical structure
  - evidence-based arguments
  - critical and objective analysis
  - scholarly engagement
  - methodological rigour 方法论严谨
  - ethical considerations
  - proper referencing
  - implications and suggestions
- reader wants:
  - entertainment
  - new factual knowledge
  - practical solutions
- should not contain:
  - the history of the research project
  - opinion presented as fact, unsupported claims
  - jokes
  - essay
  - wiki speculation 猜测
  - "Just so" stories and creation myths 只是这样和神话
  - complaint

## 4. Research and Library Resources

- advanced search:
  - (Robotics OR “Artificial Intelligence”) AND Vision
- field
  - draw a field
  - helps know current situation
  - find your place
- cannot read everything
  - start with title, abstract, content...
- be critical
  - read and write with questions
  - objectives, motivations
  - basis
  - why is it matter
- structure
  - chronological: early to late
  - perspective of authors: different views
  - methodological: different methods
  - topical/thematic: presented in sequence, like an essay
  
## 5.1. Timely Research and Innovation (Rajkumar Buyya)

- back water research
- use-inspired or blue-sky
- develop solution
- work on an emerging research area
- have skills related to: apps, algorithms, systems, programming languages, security, scheduling, etc

- Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies 2024
  - human like AI
  - post quantum cryptography

- publish or perish
- ASAP
- patent and prosper

- publish
  - book
  - free book doesn't matter, sharing is purpose
  - journal or conference
  - A* is not important, good idea is important
  - gold is gold anywhere


## 5.2. Common Mistakes in Performance Analysis

1. Is the system correctly defined and the goals clearly stated?
2. Are the goals stated in an unbiased manner
3. Have all the steps of the analysis followed systematically?
4. Is the problem clearly understood before analyzing it?
5. Are the performance metrics relevant for this problem?
6. Is the workload correct for this problem? 7. Is the evaluation technique appropriate?
8. Is the list of parameters that affect performance complete?
9. Have all parameters that affect performance been chosen as factors to be varied?
10. Is the experimental design efficient in terms of time and results?
11. Is the level of detail proper?
12. Is the measured data presented with analysis and interpretation?
13. Is the analysis statistically correct?
14. Has the sensitivity analysis been done?
15. Would errors in the input cause an insignificant change in the results?
16. Have the outliers in the input or output been treated properly?
17. Have the future changes in the system and workload been modeled?
18. Has the variance of input been taken into account?
19. Has the variance of the result been analyzed?
20. Is the analysis easy to explain?
21. Is the presentation style suitable for its audience?
22. Have the results been presented graphically as much as possible?
23. Are the assumptions and limitations of the analysis clearly documented?

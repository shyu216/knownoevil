:::

## 1. Treap

- tree + heap

## 2. Admortized Analysis

- always have balance
- prepaid
- potential

## 3. Quake Heap

- x tournament trees

## 4. Splay Tree

- splay after every operation
- practical somehow

## 5. Hashing

- usually static/fixed size
- perfect hashing: two-level hashing ensuring no collision
- cuckoo hashing: x hash functions, allowing insertion

## 6. Range Tree

- multidimension sort

## 7. Min Cut/Max Flow

- adjacency list
- union find
- matching
- bipartite graph

## 8. Linear Programming

- given a set of linear inequalities, find the maximum/minimum value of a linear function
- vertex cover
- set cover
- factor-x approximation
- duality

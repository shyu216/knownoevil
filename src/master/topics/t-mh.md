With the growing adoption of wearable and mobile devices, the use of AI in mobile health is becoming increasingly relevant for a variety of healthcare applications. However, deploying AI models on these resource-limited client devices poses significant challenges, restricting their applicability. This is especially the case with the introduction of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs, which require substantial memory and therefore present additional deployment hurdles.


Furthermore, safeguarding the privacy of sensitive client information necessitates local data processing. A promising approach is to design a collaborative learning framework that processes sensitive data locally while utilizing the cloud's extensive resources. 


Additionally, client devices may only support limited modalities such as speech and images, while others might include additional sensor data like PPG and ECG. Thus, effectively harnessing comprehensive information through collaborative learning is also vital.


This project aims to develop a collaborative learning framework that enhances health inference and privacy and effectively leverages information across multiple modalities. By integrating both small and large language models on client devices and the cloud, this approach seeks to secure sensitive data and optimize the utilization of local and cloud resources for improved health outcomes.

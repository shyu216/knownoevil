# COMP90084 Quantum Software Fundamentals

## 1. Linear Algebra

- inner product: two vertics, a number
- outer product: two vertics, a matrix

## 2. Quantum Systems

- utilise vector and linear algebra, estimate the states of different tacks
- canonical basis: a vector with k dimensions, where there is one 1 and the rest are 0
- any abitrarily complex vector can be represented as a linear combination of the canonical basis
- Kets algebra: addition, scalar multiplication, subtraction
-

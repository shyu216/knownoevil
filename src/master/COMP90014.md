## 2. Sequence Alignment and Mapping

- why align sequence
  - compare sequence
  - assess similarity
  - find evolutionary relationships
  - identify functionally conserved sequences
  - homology 同源性，指不同生物体的基因或蛋白质序列由于共同的祖先而具有相似性，有助于理解生物进化、基因功能和结构
    - homologs 同源基因
    - orthologs 直系 separated by speciation
    - paralogs 旁系 separated by duplication
  - phylogeny 系统发育 infer the evolutionary relationships among sequences
  - protein function, find regions of known function, infer function
  - conservation, find conserved regions 在不同物种或不同基因组中，某些基因或蛋白质序列在进化过程中保持不变或变化很小的区域，通常这些序列在生物学功能上具有重要性
  - data searching
  - de novo assembly, reconstruct the original sequence
  - read mapping, infer variants
- how to align
  - pairwise
  - BLAST
- Hamming distance
  - for equal length sequences, count the number of different characters
- kmer distance
  - for unequal length sequences, count the number of different kmers
- Levenshtein distance (pairwise)
  - edit distance
  - 最小编辑距离，指两个字符串之间，由一个转换成另一个所需的最少编辑操作次数
  - count mismatch, insertion, deletion as transformations
  - argmin of 
    - (i-1, j-1) + (missmatch 1 or match 0)
    - (i-1, j) + (gap 1)
    - (i, j-1) + (gap 1)
  - return the bottom-right cell of the matrix
- pairwise distance with penalties
  - apply penalties
    - i.e. match 0, mismatch -1, gap -2
  - return the bottom-right cell of the matrix
- Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (global)
  - return the bottom-right cell of the matrix
- Smith-Waterman algorithm (local)
  - return the maximum value in the matrix
- semi-global alignment
  - clipped by best offset
  - Needleman-Wunsch variant
    - start from max cell, end at reaching top row/left column
- (scoring) substitution matrix 替换矩阵
  - assign scores to each pair of characters
  - why not use fixed scores
    - two types of DNA mutations 两种DNA突变
      - transition, purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine, frequently (A↔G, C↔T)
      - transversion, purine to pyrimidine or vice versa, less likely (A↔C, A↔T, G↔C, G↔T)
  - it reflect
    - chemical similarity
    - observed mutation frequencies
    - how proteins sequence evolve
- Point Accepted Mutation (PAM) matrix
  - the number represents the evolutionary distance between the sequences
  - higher numbers denote greater distances
  - limitation
    - only for closely related sequences and small dataset
    - not consider different rates of evolution
- BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix (BLOSUM) matrix
  - scores derived from frequencies of substitutions in blocks of ungapped local alignments
  - BLOSUM62: 62% identity
- gap panalty
  - negative score
  - fixed / affine
- read mapping
  - seed extension
    - combine indexing and alignment
    - process
      1. index kmer
      2. find seed
      3. extend seed using alignment
      4. return best
  - seed chain align
    - for long, noisy sequences
    - process
      1. find seeds
      2. identify colinear chains
      3. base-level alignments to fill gaps
      4. return best
- Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)
  - efficient heuristic
    - DNA translated to protein seq for use
      - Amino Acid (AA) sequences more conserved than DNA
      - degeneracy / codon wobble
      - 3rd base in codon: multiple different nucleotides encode same AA
      - eliminate unnecessary DNA mismatches
      - more useful kmer hits
    - low-complexity regions removed
      - repetitive DNA
    - exploit kmer
      - generate 'neighbors'
      - allow mismatches
      - ungapped alignment and pick with threshold

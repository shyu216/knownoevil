## 1. Indexing

## 2. Sequence Alignment and Mapping

## 3.1. Comparing Sequences

- heuristic: progressive alignment
  1. construct a matrix
  2. construct a guide tree
  3. align sequences
- Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)
  - one to many query
  1. split query into words
  2. find neighbourhood words of similar words
  3. collect seeds
  4. extend seeds
  5. get the best alignment
- kmer
- minhash
  - fingerprint, known as kmers
  - big data
- Jaccard Coefficient
  - measure the similarity
  - proportion
  - J(A, B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|
- minimizers
  - window
  - minimizer: select the minimum kmer from a window according to an order
- shazam
  - search audio
  - audio, fingerprint, hash, reproducible
- limitation
  - window size W and kmer size k trade-off
  - longer kmer, more informative
  - bigger window, more accurate, less efficient

## 3.2. Graph Theory

- graph, interaction, biology
- describe and analyse relationships
- nodes, edges
- labels, directional, weights
- adjacent, degree
- walk (edge), path (node), cycle (closed path)
- Eulerian path: visit each edge once and only once
- Hamiltonian path: visit each node exactly once, NP-complete
- tree, usually sparse
- clique, edges between all pairs of nodes
- graph, adjacency list, adjacency matrix
- traversals: depth-first search, breadth-first search
- recursion

## 4.1. Network Analysis

- connected?
- distance of nodes?
- density?
- diversity of distribution? (node degree distribution)
- centrality
  - degree
  - closeness
  - betweenness
  - eigenvector
- classification of networks
  - scale-free
  - small-world
  - random
  - regular

## 4.2. Advanced Indexing

- trie (prefix tree or radix tree)
  - used in word retrieval
- suffix tree
  - complexity, space
- suffix array
